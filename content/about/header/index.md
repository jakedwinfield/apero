  About me

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Program Supervisor, Senior Research Analyst at Detroit Public Schools Community District in the Department of Research and Data Science. My work at DPSCD largely focuses on program evaluation of various initiatives to improve student outcomes. 

My dissertation, supported by an AERA-NSF dissertation grant, examined access and enrollment in dual enrollment courses using QuantCrit and intersectionality. More information about my work is available [here](https://jakedwinfield.com/project/dissertation/). 

Before my graduate school, I taught high school math in rural Arkansas and Phoenix, Arizona in high schools that predominantly served Black and Latinx students, respectively.
