  About me
---

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Ph.D. student in Policy and Organizational Studies at Temple University. I research the intersection of community-university relationships and college access for minoritized students using multiple methods and critical race theory. I currently wors as a teaching assistant for undergraduate research methods courses and general education courses in the College of Education and Human Development. Before graduate school, I taught high school math in rural Arkansas and Phoenix, Arizona in high schools that predominantly served Black and Latinx students, respectively.
