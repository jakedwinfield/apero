In this [article](https://doi.org/10.1080/26906015.2021.1930291) published in the *Journal of First-generation Student Success*, Cassy Pressimone Beckowski and I analyze mission statements of colleges that have made an explicit, public commitment to serving first-gen students by becoming recognized as First-gen forward institutions. We have presented this paper for practitioners in collaboration with Mikaela Mokofisi of Salt Lake Community College for [NASPA's Center for First-generation Student Success](https://naspa.org/events/making-missions-work-mission-driven-first-generation-student-initiatives) in November, 2021. 

## Abstract
Institutions of higher education continue to seek ways to engage first-generation students. This content analysis of the 157 mission statements of First-gen Forward Institutions explores how the articulation of institutional priorities can signal or promote a success-oriented culture and inform campus-wide approaches to first-generation student success. We identify four predominant themes--student learning experiences; community-serving; diversity and inclusion; and access and affordability--that may help guide unified, mission-centric efforts to develop resources and opportunities that resist deficit-based assumptions about first-generation students and that reflect an institutional commitment to student success.
