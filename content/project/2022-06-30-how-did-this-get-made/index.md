This website is built in R using the Hugo Apéro theme by [Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/). Hill's guides are very clear and easy to follow. Building this site has expanded my knowledge of R, Github, Markdown, and the backend of websites. 

Hill has provided numerous different tools for implementation I found useful including:

### A Documentation Website
This website, [https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/](), provides documentation for implementation in written form. In addition to implementation it also provides an example of what Apéro and Markdown can do. 

### Youtube Videos
Hill has recorded [numerous videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzxicn7kBeay3kTPuTQ9lSi7I5jfWmEwc) where she developed Apéro websites. I personally used the videos below to develop this site:

#### [Introduce Yourself online using blogdown and Hugo Apero ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RksaNh5Ywbo&list=PLzxicn7kBeay3kTPuTQ9lSi7I5jfWmEwc&index=2&t=7169s)

#### [Day 09: Hugo Apero from scratch || rmarkdown + blogdown + Netlify #12DaysOfDusting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXFu_upDL2o&list=PLzxicn7kBeay3kTPuTQ9lSi7I5jfWmEwc&index=7)

The code for my website is available on my [github](https://github.com/jakedwinfield/apero) - it is admittedly not nearly as nice or well docmented as Hill's work above but can show you what the back-end of this site looks like in practice. Feel free to reach out if you'd like help troubleshooting.
