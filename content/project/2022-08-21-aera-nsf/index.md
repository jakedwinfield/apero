I was awarded an AERA-NSF Dissertation Fellowship for the 2022-23 academic year for my study **Hiding in plain sight: A QuantCrit, Intersectional Analysis of Dual Enrollment**. Below is information about that project. 

### Applications

I first applied in October 2021 and was not awarded a fellowship. After receiving my rejection in December, I made some very small revisions and resubmitted an application January 2022. In this second cycle I was awarded I fellowship. I am sharing both of my application materials below, in the spirit of other scholars including [Alberto Guzman-Alvarez](https://albertoguz.com/resources/) & [Chris Bennett](https://chrisbennettedu.com/home-2/resources/). This [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ChrisBennettEdu/status/1430567863367184386) maintained by Chris Bennett contains other fellowship materials, particularly for the Spencer Dissertation Fellowship. My materials are by no means perfect, but instead may be a resource to you. I'm also sharing both sets of materials to highlight that there are many qualified applicants and some degree of luck is required to receive a fellowship.
