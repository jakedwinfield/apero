My dissertation, **Hiding in plain sight: A QuantCrit, Intersectional Analysis of Dual Enrollment**, applies critical race theory and critical quantitative analysis to dual enrollment. I also examine the importance of place - how one's proximity to a highly accessible college may influence one's ability to participate and then benefit from dual enrollment programs. I defended my dissertation in April 2023. 

Here is a link to my [dissertation](https://scholarshare.temple.edu/handle/20.500.12613/8530) and [presentation for my dissertation defense](Winfield_Defense_20230418.pdf).

### AERA-NSF Dissertation Fellowship

I was awarded an AERA-NSF Dissertation Fellowship for the 2022-23 academic year for my study. Below is information about that project.

#### Applications

I first applied in October 2021 and was not awarded a fellowship. After receiving my rejection in December, I made some very small revisions and resubmitted an application January 2022. In this second cycle I was awarded I fellowship. I am sharing both of my application materials below, in the spirit of other scholars including [Alberto Guzman-Alvarez](https://albertoguz.com/resources/) & [Chris Bennett](https://chrisbennettedu.com/home-2/resources/). This [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ChrisBennettEdu/status/1430567863367184386) maintained by Chris Bennett contains other fellowship materials, particularly for the Spencer Dissertation Fellowship. My materials are by no means perfect, but instead may be a resource to future applicants. I'm also sharing both sets of materials to highlight that there are many qualified applicants and some degree of luck is required to receive a fellowship.
