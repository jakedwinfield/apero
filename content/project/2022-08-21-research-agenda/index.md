My research agenda sits at the intersection of community-university relationships/partnerships and college access. My work seeks to understand how universities can build partnerships with their nearby communities to improve college going rates for underrepresented minority students. As a high school math teacher working to support Students of Color to and through college, I came to believe that system level changes are necessary to meaningfully increase college going rates and that colleges themselves should take an active role in their communities to address college going disparities. I am also interested in the role space plays in educational inequalities. 

Methodologically I am a pragmatist - my research aims to address important problems and foster change. My methods are driven by the questions my collaborators and I seek to answer and have included qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches. Theoretically I have most frequently utilized on critical race theory and Black feminist thought to understand the role systemic racism has on educational systems (See [Winfield & Davis, 2020](https://jakedwinfield.com/blog/jcshesa-2020/) and [Winfield et al., 2022](https://jakedwinfield.com/blog/jces-2022/)). This includes [my dissertation](https://jakedwinfield.com/project/dissertation) which uses intersectionality to study dual enrollment. I believe these critical theoretical perspectives are essential today when scholarship on race and racism is threatened and demonized by politicians and the general public. 

My research currently has two main areas of focus: community-university relationships and college access. I look forward to integrating these domains more closely in future research. 

### Community-University Relationships
As a doctoral student, I have worked to understand the promises and failures of community-university partnerships with predominantly Black, low-income communities. This includes the following scholarship:

### College Access & Success
I began my career as an educator to support students on their journey to and through college. This emerging area of my research includes my dissertation that uses critical race theory to examine access to and benefits of dual enrollment.

### Other Research Threads

As a graduate student I've also worked on other education research projects. 

#### The Education Workforce
Educator working conditions are student learning conditions. I've been a part of two projects that examine these working conditions.

#### Colleges as Organizations
I have also studied colleges as organizations by examining their public commitments to student success and their built environments.
